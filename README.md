# OPTIMIZATION DONE ON MAIN.JS FOR PIZZA PAGE
-I inserted cs loader per google's recommendation, this function loads the css after the initial painting of the page. This applies styles when the page is finished loading without blocking the render of the crtical content. 
-In the updatePosition(), I added topScrol variable which takes scrollTop and divides it by viewport size.

- Combined css loader function with main.js file, then minified it (combined-min.js).
